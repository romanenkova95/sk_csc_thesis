I highly recommend reading a guide by Professor Oleg V. Vasilyev on dissertation writing (added in the repository), especially before you start to write the Introduction part. The Introduction part in a VAK-alike dissertation has a rigorous structure, comprising a particular set of paragraphs. This part typically completely repeats the introductory part from the Synopsis.
